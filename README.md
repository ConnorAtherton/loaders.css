Delightful and performance-focused pure css loading animations.

### What is this?

[See the demo](http://connoratherton.com/loaders)

A collection of loading animations written entirely in css.
Each animation is limited to a small subset of css properties in order
to avoid expensive painting and layout calculations.

I've posted links below to some fantastic articles that go into this
in a lot more detail.

### Install

```
bower install loaders.css
```

```
npm i --save loaders.css
```

### Usage

##### Standard
- Include `loaders.min.css`
- Create an element and add the animation class (e.g. `<div class="loader-inner ball-pulse"></div>`)
- Insert the appropriate number of `<div>`s into that element

##### jQuery (optional)
- Include `loaders.min.css`, jQuery, and `loaders.css.js`
- Create an element and add the animation class (e.g. `<div class="loader-inner ball-pulse"></div>`)
- `loaders.js` is a simple helper to inject the correct number of div elements for each animation
- To initialise loaders that are added after page load select the div and call `loaders` on them (e.g. `$('.loader-inner').loaders()`)
- Enjoy

### Customising

##### Changing the background color

Add styles to the correct child `div` elements

``` css
.ball-grid-pulse > div {
  background-color: orange;
}
```

##### Changing the loader size

Use a [2D Scale](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform-function/scale) `transform`

```css
.loader-small .loader-inner {
  transform: scale(0.5, 0.5);
}
```

### Browser support

Check the [can I use](http://caniuse.com/#search=css-animation) [tables](http://caniuse.com/#search=css-transform).
All recent versions of the major browsers are supported and it has support back to IE9.

Note: The loaders aren't run through autoprefixer, see this [issue](https://github.com/ConnorAtherton/loaders.css/issues/18).

### Contributing

Pull requests are welcome! Create another file in `src/animations`
and load it in `src/loader.scss`.

In a separate tab run `gulp --require coffee-script/register`. Open `demo/demo.html`
in a browser to see your animation running.

### Inspired by loaders.css

A few other folks have taken loaders and ported them elsewhere.

- **React** - [Jon Jaques](https://github.com/jonjaques) built a React demo you can check out [here](https://github.com/jonjaques/react-loaders)
- **Vue** - [Kirill Khoroshilov](https://github.com/Hokid) loaders wrapped into components [vue-loaders](https://github.com/Hokid/vue-loaders)
- **Angular** - [the-corman](https://github.com/the-cormoran/angular-loaders) created some directives for angular, as did [Masadow](https://github.com/Masadow) in [this pr](https://github.com/ConnorAtherton/loaders.css/pull/50)
- **Ember** - [Stanislav Romanov](https://github.com/kaermorchen) created an Ember addon [ember-cli-loaders](https://github.com/kaermorchen/ember-cli-loaders) for using Loaders.css in Ember applications
- **iOS** - [ninjaprox](https://github.com/ninjaprox/NVActivityIndicatorView) and [ontovnik](https://github.com/gontovnik/DGActivityIndicatorView)
- **Android** - [Jack Wang](https://github.com/81813780/AVLoadingIndicatorView) created a library and [technofreaky](https://github.com/technofreaky/Loaders.CSS-Android-App) created an app
